# React is Awesome!
---
Welcome to your first foray into the world of ReactJS!

### Release 1: Setup

<p>In this release you'll be building an app using api data from the React is Awesome Backend</p>

#### To get started:
1. View the API at [backend](../../../react-is-awesome-backend)
1. You can connect to the actual server running this API at https://react-is-awesome-backend.herokuapp.com


<p>Once your server is running try the following command in your command line from the `/react-is-awesome` directory:</p>

```
$ curl https://react-is-awesome-backend.herokuapp.com/books/1
```
<p>If everything is working correctly your response should look similar to the following:</p>

```
{"id":1,"title":"Shall not Perish","author":"Mr. Adonis Koch","publisher":"Mapin Publishing","genre":"Tall tale","created_at":"2017-10-23T16:26:52.653Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T16:26:52.653Z"}
```
### Release 2: Wireframing/planning

<p>In this you'll go read [the documentation](../../../react-is-awesome-backend) for the backend provided and see what kind of app you can build.</p>
<p>Current available endpoints pertain to users, books, and friends.</p>

Some possible apps:

  - A library interface
  - A Goodreads clone
  - What else?

<p>When you have decided on you app that you're going to build start designing it! Start by wireframing one of the index pages. What components are necessary?</p>
<p>When you have your wireframe done get approval from an instructor before you start building</p>

### Release 3: Build your app!
** Good luck! **

Talk to an instructor before modifying the backend.
